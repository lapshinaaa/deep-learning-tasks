        "\n",
        "Users and items (products / movies / etc.) with fewer interactions than a predefined threshold are removed. This reduces the sparsity of the interaction matrix and minimizes noise.\n",

The model was proposed in 2018 (Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley). Its goal is to effectively capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in a user's interaction sequence in order to predict future interests.\n",

        "- Transformer Encoder: a sequential stack of $l$ Transformer encoder blocks with a causal mask. Each block consists of a self-attention layer and a position-wise feed-forward layer, along with residual connections and layer normalization.\n",
        "- Prediction Layer: for each position $t$, the encoder output $\\mathbf{F}^{(b)}_t$ is multiplied (dot product) with the embedding of each item in the catalog $\\mathbf{M}_i$ to obtain a relevance score $r_{i, t}$ for every item.\n",
