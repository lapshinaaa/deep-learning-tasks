        "\n",
        "Users and items (products / movies / etc.) with fewer interactions than a predefined threshold are removed. This reduces the sparsity of the interaction matrix and minimizes noise.\n",

        "In this work, we instead use a time-based split, because LOO introduces data leakage — the model should not observe future events during training. Moreover, LOO poorly correlates with real-world production scenarios.\n",

        "SASRec (Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation) - это нейросетевая модель для последовательных рекомендаций, основанная на архитектуре трансформера и механизме самовнимания (self-attention). Модель была предложена в 2018 году (Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley). Её цель - эффективно учитывать как краткосрочные, так и долгосрочные зависимости в последовательности действий пользователя, чтобы предсказывать его будущие интересы. SASRec адаптирует идеи self-attention из NLP для задачи рекомендаций, что позволяет ей быть одновременно интерпретируемой, масштабируемой и быстрой по сравнению с RNN и CNN. Оригинальная статья, которая описывает подход находится вот [тут](http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09781).\n",
